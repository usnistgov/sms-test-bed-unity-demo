# NIST Smart Manufacturing Systems (SMS) Test Bed Unity Demonstration: Integrating MTConnect and IndoorGML
---
## Objective
The goal of this project is to link performance data and geospatial information of manfuacutring assets through standard representations.  Our [ASME CIE 2020 paper](https://www.nist.gov/publications/linking-performance-data-and-geospatial-information-manufacturing-assets-through) details the integration of [MTConnect](https://www.mtconnect.org/) and [IndoorGML](https://www.ogc.org/standards/indoorgml).  Through this demonstration, we showcase two use cases derived from the underlying mapping between the standards.  The first use case shows the quick three-dimensional (3D) rendering and presentation of a shop floor for situational awareness.  The second use case presented demonstrates a tablet-based guidance for navigation from one job to another on the shop floor.  Both use cases were generated by leveraging existing tools and methods already produced in accordance with the standards.  In our minds, this demonstrates the power of standards in that leveraging tools that interface with standard data representation is much easier than building each component from scratch.  

## Prototype details
This repository showcases a prototype.  We designed the prototype to interface directly with data streaming from the [SMS Test Bed](https://www.nist.gov/laboratories/tools-instruments/smart-manufacturing-systems-sms-test-bed).  To apply these concepts to other manfuacturing installations, considerable rework is required.  Furthermore, we do not provide precise 3D models for the individual machines from the SMS Test Bed.  Instead, we use open and free 3D models of similar machines from [GrabCAD](https://grabcad.com/).  Similarly, we do not include the precise manuals for each machine represnted.  Instead, we use publicly available machine tool manuals for demonstration purposes only.
